# OSCKit
A Swift framework for sending, receiving, and parsing OSC messages &amp; bundles.

Largely inspired and adapted from [Figure 53](http://figure53.com) OSC library [F53OSC](https://github.com/Figure53/F53OSC).

For convenience, we've included a few public domain source files:

[CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket).  
[Swift-Netutils] (https://github.com/svdo/swift-netutils).

Thanks and curiosity should rightfully be directed to towards them.

## Demo
